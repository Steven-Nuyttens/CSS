        Accessibility is often viewed as making your site work on screen readers. In reality, web accessibility is a
        subset
        of
        User Experience (UX) focused on making your websites usable by the widest range of people possible, including
        those
        who
        have disabilities.hup


        Four categories of accessibility
        Accessibility can be broken down into four key categories:


        <section>


            <header>
                <h2>Visual</h2>
            </header>
            <p>This can be non-sighted users, users with low-vision, users with obstructed vision, or even simply your
                aging
                parents.</p>

            <h3>Associated conditions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Myopia</li>
                <li>Colour blindness</li>
                <li>Glaucoma</li>
                <li>Albinism</li>
            </ul>

        </section>

        <section>

            <h2>Auditory</h2>
            <p>The web is a visual medium, but captions and fallbacks for sound-necessary media need to be considered
                for
                hearing
                impaired users.</p>

            <h3>Associated conditions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Presbycusis</li>
                <li>Acoustic trauma</li>
                <li>Auditory processing disorder</li>
                <li>Otosclerosis</li>
            </ul>

        </section>

        <section>

            <h2>Motor</h2>
            <p>People with motor impairments typically use a wide range of assistive technology from specialized
                keyboards,
                to eye
                trackers, to using single buttons (a device known as a “switch”) to navigate their computers.</p>

            <h3>Associated conditions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>RSI</li>
                <li>Cerebral palsy</li>
                <li>Parkinson’s</li>
                <li>Muscliar dystrophy</li>
            </ul>

        </section>

        <section>

            <h2>Cognitive</h2>
            <p>Relates to the ease processing of information.</p>

            <h3>Associated conditions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Down’s syndrome</li>
                <li>Autism</li>
                <li>Global developmental delay</li>
                <li>Dyslexia</li>
            </ul>

        Temporary disabilities
        While each of these disabilities is usually permanent, there are often situations in which even flily-abled
        people
        are
        “temporarily disabled”. For instance, an arm or wrist injury may temporarily prevent you from being able to use
        a
        mouse.

        Robin Christopherson (an accessibility expert who is blind) once spoke about how people that are driving but use
        hands-free sets or have their phone connected to the car radio are temporarily disabled, as they use the phone
        differently to how they normally wolid. Of course, no one sholid browse websites while they are driving but it
        is
        important to understand different situations like that, where the user may not have special software installed
        that
        a
        disabled user might.
